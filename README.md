Additional concepts covered include processes, concurrency, virtual memory and I/O management, file management, networking and distributed processing. Students will become familiar with several different operating systems. Fall


## PREREQUISITES/ CO-REQUISITES
Prerequisite: CSC 303 – Data Structures


## COURSE OBJECTIVES
Computer Science is about problem solving. This course will deal specifically with the internals of operating systems with an emphasis on the inventive process and the problems solved through the generations of development that have occurred.


## TEXTBOOKS AND OTHER MATERIALS
1. Understanding Operating Systems 8th Edition by Ann McHoes and Ida M. Flynn (https://www.cengage.com/c/understanding-operating-systems-8e-mchoes/9781305674257PF/)

## ACADEMIC HONESTY
Programming in the computer science industry involves working in teams. As such, teamwork, sharing ideas, and problem solving with other students is encouraged. This “teamwork,” however, comes with the usual responsibility of giving credit where credit is due, citing sources, etc. While it is encouraged to help each other, each student is expected to individually wrestle with the problem at hand and work towards a solution. “Borrowing” another students code, in bulk, into your own is unacceptable and cheats yourself out of the learning that comes from personally struggling to solve problems.

College of the Ozarks expects and demands high standards of intellectual honesty from its students. Those high standards demand that dishonest work be rejected and that those students engaging in such work bear the consequences, which may include zero credit on assignments, failing course grades, and/or expulsion from the college.

Cheating on quizzes, tests, examinations, or other graded exercises is (1) borrowing someone’s answers, (2) providing answers for other students, (3) using unauthorized material during the exercises, or (4) the acquisition, without permission, of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of the College faculty or staff.

Plagiarism, or academic theft, is presenting the words or ideas of someone else as one’s own in an assignment without giving them due credit as the originator of those words or ideas. A student is guilty of plagiarism if he or she submits as his or her own work a written or spoken assignment that contains words or ideas copied from another person’s book, article, manuscript, notes, Internet site, calculations, translations, computer programs, or any other source. Obviously, turning in another student’s assignment or a paper totally taken from someone else’s work is plagiarism. But it is also plagiarism to reword or summarize the words or ideas of another author and present them as part of one’s assignment unless one gives the author credit. Plagiarism occurs when a student uses a sequence of words or ideas without having digested, integrated, and reorganized the author’s words in his or her own mind and without acknowledgment in the assignment.

Similarly, a student is an accomplice in plagiarism and equally guilty (1) if he allows his own words in outline or finished form to be copied and submitted as the work of another; (2) if he prepares an assignment for another student and allows it to be submitted as that other student’s work; or (3) if he keeps or contributes to a file of papers, speeches, tests, lab work, or other assignments with the clear intent that they be copied and submitted as the work of anyone other than the author. Students should keep paper and electronic copies of all their notes and all their drafts of assignments to help prove their authorship in case questions of plagiarism should arise.


## HONOR CODE
I agree to be an honest, trustworthy, caring and responsible citizen. I will uphold these values in others and myself.


## ATTENDANCE & COURSE POLICIES
__Attendance:__ The level of student success in a class such as this is directly related to his or her class attendance. Students will attend class regularly and participate.

__Special Needs:__ I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations/adaptations that may be required for students with disabilities. Please make these requests during the first week of the semester such that arrangements can be made. It is your responsibility to notify me of any special arrangements or needs you may require.

__Software:__ In class, we will use the command line Python tools (e.g., python and python3) and the Spyder Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Both the Python (Anaconda) and Sypder are available for install on
your personal computers at no charge.

__Assignments:__ You will not pass this class without completing the assignments. Assignments must be turned in on time. Unless otherwise directed, assignments will be submitted via CampusWeb on or before the due date. In general, late assignments will be assessed a 50% point deduction for the first day late and will not be accepted after that day unless you have an excused absence. Some assignments will be completed during class time and will not be accepted after the due date/time for credit.

## CAVEAT
The schedule and procedures in this course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances.
